Haliax is a [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) library for building neural networks with named tensors, in the tradition of Alexander Rush's [Tensor Considered Harmful](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/NamedTensor).
Named tensors improve the **legibility** and **compositionality** of tensor programs by using named axes instead of positional indices
as typically used in NumPy, PyTorch, etc.

Despite the focus on legibility, Haliax
is also **fast**, typically about as fast as "pure" JAX code.
Haliax is also built to be **scalable**: it
can support [Fully-Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP)](https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/15/open-source/fsdp/) and Tensor Parallelism with [just a few lines of code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QX4yH3zRFF3Xiibf1aahETcSQ5nbcUMz). Haliax powers [Levanter](https://github.com/stanford-crfm/levanter),
our companion library for training large language models and other foundation models, with scale proven up to 70B parameters
and up to TPU v4-2048.

## Example: Attention

Here's a minimal attention module implementation in Haliax. For a more detailed introduction,
please see the [Haliax tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TiTcQQ4V5mopbgCu1SVl-oqJtXn7rFnC).
(We use the excellent [Equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox) library for its module system and tree transformations.)

```python
import equinox as eqx
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import haliax as hax
import haliax.nn as hnn

shape = {
    "position": 1024,
    "key_position": 1024,
    "head": 8,
    "key": 64,
    "embed": 512,
}

# alternatively, create Axis objects explicitly
# Pos, KPos, Head, Key, Embed = hax.make_axes(**shape)


def attention_scores(query, key, mask):
    # how similar is each query to each key
    scores = hax.dot(query, key, axis="key") / jnp.sqrt(shape["key"])

    if mask is not None:
        scores -= 1E9 * (1.0 - mask)

    # convert to probabilities
    scores = hnn.softmax(scores, "key_position")
    return scores


def attention(query, key, value, mask):
    scores = attention_scores(query, key, mask)
    answers = hax.dot(scores, value, axis="key_position")

    return answers


# Causal Mask means that if pos >= key_pos, then pos can attend to key_pos
causal_mask = (
    hax.arange({"position": shape["position"]}).broadcast_axis("key_position")
    >= hax.arange({"key_position": shape["key_position"]})
)


class Attention(eqx.Module):
    proj_q: hnn.Linear  # [embed] -> [head, key]
    proj_k: hnn.Linear  # [embed] -> [head, key]
    proj_v: hnn.Linear  # [embed] -> [head, key]
    proj_answer: hnn.Linear  # [head, key] -> [embed]

    @staticmethod
    def init(shape, *, key):
        k_q, k_k, k_v, k_ans = jax.random.split(key, 4)
        proj_q = hnn.Linear.init(
            In={"embed": shape["embed"]},
            Out={"head": shape["head"], "key": shape["key"]},
            key=k_q,
        )
        proj_k = hnn.Linear.init(
            In={"embed": shape["embed"]},
            Out={"head": shape["head"], "key": shape["key"]},
            key=k_k,
        )
        proj_v = hnn.Linear.init(
            In={"embed": shape["embed"]},
            Out={"head": shape["head"], "key": shape["key"]},
            key=k_v,
        )
        proj_answer = hnn.Linear.init(
            In={"head": shape["head"], "key": shape["key"]},
            Out={"embed": shape["embed"]},
            key=k_ans,
        )
        return Attention(proj_q, proj_k, proj_v, proj_answer)

    def __call__(self, x, mask=None):
        q = self.proj_q(x)
        # Rename "position" to "key_position" for self attention
        k = self.proj_k(x).rename({"position": "key_position"})
        v = self.proj_v(x).rename({"position": "key_position"})

        answers = attention(q, k, v, causal_mask)

        x = self.proj_answer(answers)
        return x
```
