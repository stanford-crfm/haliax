class ScanCheckpointPolicy:
    """
    A class that represents a gradient checkpoint policy for blocks in a Stacked module. This is used to control
    gradient checkpointing in [haliax.scan][], [haliax.fold][], [haliax.nn.Stacked][] and [haliax.nn.BlockSeq][].

    Gradient checkpointing is a technique for reducing memory usage in training large models. It works by saving only a
    subset of the forward pass and recomputing the rest in the backward pass. (By doing parts of the forward pass again)
    JAX suggests that this usually isn't necessary when not using scan-over-layers (i.e. Stacked), so this is mostly
    useful for Stacked modules.

    A scan block takes a "carry" and some extra arguments, and returns a "carry" and an "output". The "carry" is passed
    to the next block, and the "output" is concatenated into a final result (sort of like an RNN).

    Schematically it might look like this:

    ```
          I       I       I       I
          |       |       |       |
    C ->  B -C->  B -C->  B -C->  B --> C
          |       |       |       |
          O       O       O       O
    ```

    where "C" is the carry and "O" is the output. A block will typically do some computation (e.g. a Transformer block)
    as well, which might require saving or recomputing in the backward pass.

    Without checkpointing, we will save all block inputs and outputs, and use them to compute the gradient. This requires
    memory, of course. With checkpointing, we can save only some of the computation. Typically, to compute the gradient
    of the scan, we need the inputs to each block, the intermediates within each block, as well as the carries (which
    are inputs to the next block). We can save all of these, or we can save only some of them.

    With this class, you can specify if you want to save the carries, or the internals/inputs. You can also offload
    the carries to the host, which can reduce memory usage on the device.

    #### Nested Remat

    Alternatively, we can do something a bit more clever. We can break the computation into "blocks" of size "B", and
    save the carries and outputs of each block. Then, during the backward pass, we can recompute the outputs of each
    block using the carries and inputs, and then compute the gradient as usual. This requires O(B) memory and O(N)
    time. When B = sqrt(N), this is O(sqrt(N)) memory and O(N) time. This is the "nested scan" policy.
    In practice, this is about 20% slower than the O(N) memory policy, but it can be worth it for large models.

    #### Offloading

    Another choice is to "offload" carries and outputs to the host, which can reduce memory usage on the device.
    We support offloading carries and outputs to the host, but not internals.

    """
    Slightly simpler implementation of scan that folds over the named axis of the array, not returning intermediates.

    As with scan, this function is curried: it takes the function, axis, and configuration arguments first, and
    then the initial carry and then any arguments to scan over as a separate curried function call.

    Unnamed arrays will have their first axis scanned over, unless they are scalars, in which case they will be passed
    through unchanged.

    Args:
        fn: function to reduce over
        axis: axis to reduce over
        reverse: if True, reduce in reverse
        unroll: unroll the loop by this amount
        nested_scan: Use nested scans to reduce memory usage. If an integer, use that many nested scans.
                If true, use the closest int to sqrt(axis.size) that divides axis.size, which gives
                O(sqrt(N)) memory and O(N) time.
        is_scanned: a function that takes a leaf of the tree and returns True if it should be scanned over,
                    False otherwise. Behaves similarly to the `default` argument in filter_jit

    Returns:
        A function that takes the initial carry and then the arguments to reduce over, and returns the final carry
